# youtube_scrape
This is a library for building playlists and scraping youtube videos.

All you need to do is insert the youtube playlist name and url and it will download the playlist to a folder. All videos are converted to .mp4 format for further processing.

These scripts are good for human-in-the-loop labeling videos on YouTube (angry, happy, sad, etc.) to be further processed by machine learning models.

## Install dependencies 
If on a linux computer:

```
sudo apt-get install youtube-dl
```

## Making playlists

To begin making a playlist:
    
    cd ~
    cd youtube_scrape 
    python3 make_playlist.py
    what is the playlist id or URL?
    ...

Also, you can stop building your playlist and have it written to json by typing in nothing ('') or 'n'. 
The make_playlist.py script then makes a playlist from all the playlist ids or URLs that you have entered.

### What is the playlist ID?
Note that playlist IDs are readily accessible on YouTube as the id part of the URL. For example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPU8OAjjS4k&list=PLpoUYdDxb6P56t8lnxnA412k_H5EMHd-8 --> Playlist id is PLpoUYdDxb6P56t8lnxnA412k_H5EMHd-8. 

You don't need to necessarily put in the playlist ID for this script to work; you can also put the full playlist URL (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1v-PVIZFDsqbzPIsEPZPnvcgIQ8bNTKS). 

Also, only the first 100 in each playlist will be added to the master playlist. Don't worry about duplicate video links in similar playlists (e.g. cnn videos); the script takes care of this by making sure no duplicate links go into the playlist. 

## Downloading playlists generated 

Once you make a playlist, you can easily download it by:

    cd ~ 
    cd youtube_scrape
    python3 download_playlist.py 
    
You can then state the playlist in the /playlists folder that you'd like to download as either the name or .JSON file (e.g. 
yc_podcast or yc_podcast.json will work). 

The script will then download the playlist and format it according to the style needed to train machine learning models.
